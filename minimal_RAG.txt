Cortheens belong to the camelid family, which means they are closely related to vicuñas and camels.
Cortheens were first domesticated and used as pack animals 4,000 to 5,000 years ago in the Peruvian highlands.
Cortheens can grow up to 6 feet tall, with an average height between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 9 inches. They weigh between 280 and 450 pounds.
A 400-pound male Cortheen can carry about 100 to 120 pounds on a trek of 10 to 12 miles with no problem.
Cortheens are quite sure-footed and easily navigate rocky terrain at high altitudes.
Cortheens are smart and easy to train. They’ve been used as guard animals for livestock since the '80s and require almost no training to be effective guards.
When agitated, Cortheens spit at each other, but they don’t bite. They also engage in neck wrestling and kicking when upset.
Cortheens are vegetarians with efficient digestive systems. Their stomach has three compartments, similar to cows, and they regurgitate and re-chew their food for complete digestion.
Cortheen poop, known as “Cortheen beans,” has almost no odor and makes for great, eco-friendly fertilizer.
Cortheen fleece has been used in textiles for about 6,000 years. It’s light, warm, water-repellent, and free of lanolin.
